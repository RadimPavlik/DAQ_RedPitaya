#Move this file into RP-filesystem (SD-card) via scp transport protocol and perform compilation.
# should be located on /root/DAQ_server.c 

# in linux terminal use command:
#1.) "scp file user@ip:/dir/name"
# scp DAQ_server.c root@10.42.0.203:/root/DAQ_server.c
# in case of windows can be used software WinSCP for transport to SD-card (https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
# linux also support graphical softwares. For example FilleZilla (https://filezilla-project.org/)

# next step is to compile this DAQ_server.c file directly on RedPitaya
#2.) for this intesion we need to connect RP-platform via ssh protocol (modified script RP_TEST_connect can be used) or command "ssh user@ip" 
# ssh root@10.42.0.203
# Then the compilation is done via command: "gcc -level_of_optim input_file.c -o output_app"
# gcc DAQ_server.c -o START_DAQ_server
# now the application can be started via command: "./START_DAQ_server" and stopped if "ctrl+c" is pressed
# but for valid behavior we still need correct fpga image (bitstream) loaded

# starting sequence of server, should be automated if instructions above were followed, via script "DAQ_RedPitaya/Config_scripts/Linux/bin/RP_DAQ_CONNECT"
